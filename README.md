# Challenge pxnw

> Technical challenge for [mattersupply](http://mattersupply.co/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Challenge

We're transporting you back to the early 2000's – we're building a quick blog. We're asking you to build an application with two pages, one to list blog posts and a short excerpt, one to display a full blog post. The backend for this blog are Github Gists. The idea is that you can configure a username to look up on Github and the index page will display excerpts of the Gists. The post detail page will then display the full content of the gist. Possible enhancements are a searchable list of posts, only show certain Gists as blog posts, formatted Markdown as HTML etc.

## Requirements

- As a reader, I want to be able to see a list of blog posts that a writer has posted on Github in the form of Gists, so that I can make a decision on which post to read.
- As a reader, I want to be able to select a post on the index page and see the post details, so that I can read the post. 
- As a reader, I want to be able to navigate from a post to the next post so that I can read the next post.
- As a reader, I want to be able to navigate to the index page from a post so that I can select a different post to read.
- As a writer, I want to be able to post a Gist to Github and have that post show up on my blog so that a reader can read the new post.
- As a writer, I want to able to make updates to a post by updating the Gist so that I can correct typos and make content updates.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
